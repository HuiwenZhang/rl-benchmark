# rl-benchmark
simple and compact implementations of reinforcement learning benchmark algorithms

## Contents
- agents
- buffer
- demo

## test and task
You can validate all the algorithms by runing the scripts in 'demo' folder. To make our implementations simple, concise and clear,
we test all our algorithms with cart-pole environment implemented in openai gym.

To make readers understand the codes more quickly, we give a brief introduce about the cartpole task. Specifically, the env includes a  pole
attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. Action is two dimensional discrete vector and the observation
 is four dimensional continuous space

## Acknowledgement
This project borrows a lot of idea and code from other open source projects. Thanks for all of them.

## Contribution
We hope readers can test our code and pull requset if necessary. In addition, any implementation of new algorithm is welcomed.
